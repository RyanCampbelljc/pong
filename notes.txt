MULTIPLAYER
use webRTC or peerJS in order to establish the connections
will need to write some initial server code in order to originally establish the p2p connections



***NEXT***
Player should be given a position then create its own paddle.
player probably then doesnt need to store its position
Should there just be subclasses lPlayer and rPlayer in order to deal with w,s or up,down and start positions
